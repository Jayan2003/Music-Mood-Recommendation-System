\# 🎵 Music Mood Recommendation System

\*\*University Project\*\*



\## 📌 Overview

The Music Mood Recommendation System is an AI-based application that detects a user’s facial emotion from an uploaded image and recommends music that matches the detected mood.



This project was developed as part of a university coursework to demonstrate practical applications of computer vision, deep learning, and recommendation systems.
